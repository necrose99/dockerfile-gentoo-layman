# dockerfile-gentoo-laymanadd

Build a [wking/gentoo-layman](https://github.com/wking/dockerfile/tree/master/gentoo-layman) based [docker](http://docker.io) image containing layman-add.

You will probably want to extend this image rather than using it directly.

testing for a basic wildcard Arch ie not required.
